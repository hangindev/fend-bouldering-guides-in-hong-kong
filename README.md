## Bouldering Guides in Hong Kong

#### Intro
This is my Neighborhood Map Project for Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree. I developed a single page map application of the bouldering (a type of climbing) places in Hong Kong.

#### Tools used
* **Knockout JS** (responsible for list population and "event" bindings)
* **Google Map API**
* Flickr API
* jQuery
* Bootstrap

#### Instruction
* Markers of all spots are shown on map by default.
* Click menu button to see all bouldering places.
* User can apply filter places (indoor/outdoor)
* Click markers/ place titles in menu to populate corresponding info window with Flickr photos

#### Future development
* A more comprehensive database can be used and saved in a server.
* More info of the places can be shown, e.g. difficulty of the routes.
